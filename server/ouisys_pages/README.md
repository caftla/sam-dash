This functionality has been moved to ouisys-server project.

In Sigma we only call APIs from ouisys-server.

The code in this directory is stale and MUST NOT be referenced from any other module in Sigma.

As of 2 March 2019, the db module is used for fetching pages from Ouisys and for creating campaigns.

This directory should be removed.
